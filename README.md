Screaming Webshop
=================

Code examples from talk entitled Screaming Architecture with Symfony presented on Symfony User Group Berlin 
on February 22, 2017.

This repository is an example of how an empty PHP project can be started immediately with the focus on the
business logic, rather than from choosing a framework. By following the commit history you can observe, how
additional tools, especially Symfony, can be applied without interfering with the business logic.
